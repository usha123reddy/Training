GITHUB
______

->store data permanently
->gives visual experience
->gives us collaboration

GIT
___

->it is a version control system used to track the changes in the files/folders
-> untracked->tracked->store in staging area(shows the tracked files)->local repo->main repo
->commends
1.git init(initialize the empty repository)
2.git add filename(working copy[local machine] to staging area,untracked file to tracked file)
3.git commit -m "msg"(staging area to local repo , used to  write commit msg i.e., can have changes made to a particular file)
4.git push url(push code from local repo to main repo)
5.git clone url(copy of remote repo[ github ] to local machine)


Day2
____

-git  add .
-git path -u origin master
-
EA1E-F1E2

Day3
____

Hypertext-:Hyperlinks anchor tag
-used to create structure content

CSS-:add Styles to the website

JavaScript-:used to design websites

-Static: remains constant to everyone
--eg:FB login
-Dynamic:changes to everyone
--ex: FB interface,
--Youtube recommendations,
--google maps # time to time data is updated,

JavaScript
__________

-it helps to make websites dynamically and interactive.
-used both on client side(in the browser) and serverside(node js).
-it allows the webpages to change it with out reloading the entire page
-it is a scripting languages used to write scripts to develop webpages.
-it is often used for form validations.
-it was first released by "NetScape"
-it can be implemented in the html using <script> tag.
-open any browser right click>inspect>inside script tag can write javascript code
1)Variables:
____________

-python,java
-variables are used to store data(any kind of data)
-when we use same variable name the second value of the variable will rewrite old one(second value is considered ).
-variables always starts with letters,_,$ but not numbers.
-variables can include letters,numbers,_,$.
-for all the programming languages except sql variable are case-Sensitive
-space between two variable names are not allowed

Types of variables
1)var
-re-initialization
-re-declaration
2)let
-re-initialization
-re-declaration(not possible)
3)const
-re-initialization(not possible)
-re-declaration(not possible)

var(variable) u(identifier)="usha"(value/data);
console.log(u);=>it is a method to print the o/p in the developer console.
document.writeLn();=>it is the method to print the o/p on the UI

Coments are the ignored lined by the browser
1)html:-<!--comment to be done -->
css:-/*comment/*
2)

dataTypes
_________

1)primitive
 -immutable
 -can store only single values
	-String
	-number
 	-Boolean
 	-undefined
	-null
	-symbol
	-bigint
2)non-primitive
 -they are user defined
 -mutable
 -can store only multiple values
 	-array
	-functions
	-objects
	-math,date,json

3)String
________

-sequence of characters enclosed within "", '',(``)template literals/backtiks

number:-
- -2^53-1 to +2^53-1 upto this range we consider as number data type;
- beyond this range is bigint
-any value sufix with "n" will be bigint.

Boolean:-true/false

undefined:-variable is declared but not initialized with the value

null:-it is an empty value

Day4
____

1)Operators:

-They are special Type of Sysmbols used to perform some operations on operands.
ex:-a+b(a,b are operands ,+ is an operator)

Types of Operators:

-unary
-binary
-ternary(op1 ? op2 :op3)

1.Arithmatic Operators
2.Assignment Operators
3.relational Operators
4.logical Operators

1)Arithmatic Operators:
-addition
-substaction
-multiplication
-division
-modulus
-exponential
-increment(++)--increment will happen with on evalue
 -per-increment--increment before execution
 -post-increment--increment after execution
-decrement(--)
 -per-decrement
 -post-decrement

 -Concatinating:-adding 2 or more strings
 -typescasting:-converting one datatype to another
 -NaN:-not a number

 2)Assignment Operators
   - =,+=,*=,/=

3)Relational Operators
-which are used to compare two values 
-always retuens boolean
- ==,===,!=,!==,>,>=,<,<=

differences between "==" and "==="
"==" it will check value but not data Type.
"===" it will check both values and data type
 "!=" it will check value but not data Type.
"!==" it will check both values and data type
	
4)Logical Operators
-AND(&&):when both conditions are true return true else false
-OR(&&):when any one consition is true return true else false
-NOT(!):if true returns false and viseversa

5)Decision making statements:-
-if:only if condition is true then executes
-if else:
-else if ladder
-switch
-ternary

prompt():- takes values manually 

Day 5
_____

Looping statements
__________________

 -to execute a  block of code repeatedly
)))for Looping:
for(Initialization,condition,updation){
	statements
}
-when the no of iterations are known
)))while
while(condition){
	statements
}
-when the no of iterations are not known
)))do while
do(){
}
while(conditions){//entry control
	statements
}
-when the no of iterations are not known

What is entry control and exit control loop:
--entry control loops are for,while.
--exit control loops are do-while.

-)minimum iteration count of for and while is "0"
-)minimum iteration count of do-while is "1"

What is the difference between breah and continue?
break:-when condition satisfy it will terminate the loop permanently
continue:-when condition satisfy it wil skip the condition

=]Function:
___________

-it is a block of code used to perform specific task
-reusability
-javaScript also code as functionalized 
-it is a non primitive data type
syntax:- function function_name(optional oparameters){//function declaration
			//statements
		}
		function_name(arguments);
		let a=10;

Types of functions:-
____________________

1)).named functions(fun which is invoked using same nMAE)
2)).anonymus function(FUNCTION WHICH DOES NOT HAVE NAME TO DECLARE NAME AND INVOKING THE NAME)
-without decalring the function name body it cant be execute
3)).function expression //csn be called multiple times
ananymus function declaration is assigned to variable and invoked withe same variable
let x=function(){
    console.log("function expression");
};
x();
4)).Immediate invoke function expression //it can call only once
once function is created it should be invoked immediately
(function(){
    console.log("IIFE");
})
();
5)).Arrow function --it is used to concise the normal function syntax
syntax:-()=>{}
-it is similar to anonymus function
let x=()=>{
    console.log("Arrow function");
};
x();
let x=_=>
    console.log("Arrow function");

x();
6.))Higher order function
-A function which accepts another function as an arguments to its parameter.
7)).Callback function
-a function that is passed as an argument to higher order function
))closure
-is a memory where functions are bundle together by giving  an accessibility to inner most function to access the variables of the outer most function.
NOTE:-
-javascript first name is live Scrip
-brendeneach
-current version of javascript is es14.
-es6-highly used till now
-es-ECMA script
ECMA-european computer manufacturing association

use for loop
use nested for loop
use coordinates


RETURN STATEMENT:
__________________
-return the expression,variables or values
-also used to terminate or stop the execution
function test(a,b){
    console.log("hi");
    console.log("hhvj");//explicit return
    return a+b;
    console.log("hello");
}
The return keyword is used in programming to:
Finish the execution of a method.
Return a value from a method.
Exit a function and return a value.

Day 6:
_______

Arrays:
________

-array can store multiple values within a single variable.
-collection of item/values.
-array can store homogenous values and hetrogenous values.
-)Syntax:- [] 
ex:-
